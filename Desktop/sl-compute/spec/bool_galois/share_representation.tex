\section{Share Representation}

Galois-type objects are represented using Replicated Secret Sharing.
Specifically, to store some variable $x \in \GFtwol$,
there are three shares $x_1, x_2, x_3 \in \GFtwol$,
which satisfy $x_1 \Gadd x_2 \Gadd x_3 = x$.
Party $P_i$ holds shares $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$.

Security is defined in terms of the operation protocols being 
simulatable if they were replaced by the Galois ABB functionality.
In short, shares that are the result of an Input should appear
completely random to a single party (conditioned on any 
pre-existing knowledge they have of the input variable).
Correlations between shares of calculated values
(e.g. the input and output shares in an addition)
should reveal no further information to any single party beyond 
which calculation was performed.
