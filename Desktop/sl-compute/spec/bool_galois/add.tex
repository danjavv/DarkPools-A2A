\section{Addition}

Since parties hold (replicated) additive shares of secrets,
adding secrets is a simple local operation, as shown below.

\begin{protocol}[Galois Field Addition]
	$\GalAdd{\galois{x}}{\galois{y}}$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let $[(x_i, x_{i+1})]_i$ be the shares of $x$ held by $P_i$
			and $[(y_i, y_{i+1})]_i$ be the shares of $y$ held by $P_i$.
		\item $P_i$ computes $z_i = x_i \Gadd y_i$ and 
			$z_{i+1} = x_{i+1} \Gadd y_{i+1}$.
		\item $P_i$ locally sets its share of the output to be $[(z_i, z_{i+1})]$.
		\item $P_1, P_2$ and $P_3$ generate a unique consistent identifier
			for the result, which is returned.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{protocol}

\textbf{Correctness:} \\
Let $a$ be such that $P_a$ and $P_{a+1}$ are the two honest parties.
If the protocol is correct to this point, $P_a$ holds $[(x_a, x_{a+1})]_a$
and $P_{a+1}$ holds $[(x_{a+1}, x_{a+2})]_{a+1}$,
where the values of $x_{a+1}$ are the same for $P_a$ and $P_{a+1}$.
Furthermore, $x_{a} \Gadd x_{a+1} \Gadd x_{a+2} = x$, the value that should be
stored in the ABB.
The same applies to the sharings of $y$.
Since $P_{a}$ and $P_{a+1}$ are honest, they compute consistent sharings
of $z_{a+1} = x_{a+1} \Gadd y_{a+1}$. 
Furthermore they hold a sharing of 
$z_a \Gadd z_{a+1} \Gadd z_{a+2} = \
(x_a \Gadd y_a) \Gadd (x_{a+1} \Gadd y_{a+1}) \Gadd (x_{a+2} \Gadd y_{a+2}) = \
(x_a \Gadd x_{a+1} \Gadd x_{a+2}) \Gadd (y_a \Gadd y_{a+1} \Gadd y_{a+2}) = \
x \Gadd y$.
