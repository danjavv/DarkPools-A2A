\section{Share Representation}

We use Replicated Secret Sharing to represent shares of an arithmetic integer.
Specifically, to store some variable $x \in \Ztwol$, there are three shares $s_1, s_2, s_3 \in \Ztwol$, which satisfy $s_1 \Aadd s_2 \Aadd s_3 = x$.
Party $P_i$ holds shares $(t_i, s_i)$, where $t_i = s_i \Aadd s_{i - 1}$.

We denote the Arithmetic RSS sharing of $x$ using this scheme as $\aint{x}$. Security is defined in terms of the operation protocols being simulatable if they were replaced by the Arithmetic Integer ABB functionality.
In short, shares that are the result of an Input should appear completely random to a single party (conditioned on any pre-existing knowledge they have of the input variable).
Correlations between shares of calculated values (e.g. the input and output shares in an addition) should reveal no further information to any single party beyond which calculation was performed.
