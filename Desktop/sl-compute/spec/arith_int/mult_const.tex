\section{Multiplication by a Public Constant}

Since parties hold (replicated) additive shares of secrets, multiplying by a public constant is simple and requires no communication.

\begin{protocol}[Arithmetic Multiplication by a Public Constant]
	\ArithMultConst{\aint{x}}{c}:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Let $(t^x_i, s^x_i)$ be the share of $x$ held by $P_i$.
			\item $P_i$ computes $t^z_i = t^x_i \Amult c$ and $s^z_i = s^x_i \Amult c$.
			\item $P_i$ sets its shares of the result to be
				$(t^z_i, s^z_i)$.
			\item The parties generate a unique consistent public identifier for the result.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{protocol}

\textbf{Correctness:}
The argument for correctness is identical to that of the addition protocol.
If the protocol has correctly implemented the ABB up to this point, the sharing of the honest parties is consistent and correct.
The honest parties will therefore have a correct and consistent sharing of the output.
